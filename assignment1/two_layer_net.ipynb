    "We've only asked you to implement ReLU, but there are a number of different activation functions that one could use in neural networks, each with its pros and cons. In particular, an issue commonly seen with activation functions is getting zero (or close to zero) gradient flow during backpropagation. Which of the following activation functions have this problem? If you consider these functions in the one dimensional case, what types of input would lead to this behaviour?\r\n",

Moreover, there is no gap between the training and validation accuracy, suggesting that the model we used has low capacity, and that we should increase its size.

You might also consider tuning the learning rate decay, but you should be able to get good performance using the default value.\n",
